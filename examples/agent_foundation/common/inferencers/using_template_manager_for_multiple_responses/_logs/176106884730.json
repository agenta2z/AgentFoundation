Check that no critical datapoint areas are under-represented in the query list.\n- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Identify and merge overlapping queries that would retrieve substantially similar information. However, keep queries separate if they target different aspects even if topically related.\n- **Consider Search Engine Effectiveness**: Be specific and concrete. Focus each query on one clear aspect. Avoid combining disparate topics\n- **Prioritize Queries**: Rank query priorites by high/medium/low according to\n  * Information density: How much essential backstory/cultural data will this retrieve?\n  * Foundational importance: Is this core to understanding the character or supplementary detail?\n  * Uniqueness: Does this retrieve information not covered by other queries?\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"refined_query_list\": [\n    {\n      \"query\": \"the optimized search query\",\n      \"datapoint_areas\": [{\"name\": \"...\", \"index\": ...}, ... a list of datapoint areas from Phase1 this query would address],\n      \"reason\": \"why this query is essential and what unique information it retrieves\",\n      \"priority\": \"high/medium/low\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n## TASK\n\nMake detailed reasoning on what queries are needed to retrieve various data points mentioned in `OBJECTIVES` for the following AI character\n\n```character\nMeet Puss in Boots, the favorite fearless hero and swashbuckling star.\n```", "time": "2025-10-21 10:48:57"}{"level": 10, "name": "HttpRequestInferencer", "type": "InferenceArgs", "item": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 20480, "max_new_tokens": 20480, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50}, "time": "2025-10-21 10:48:57"}{"level": 10, "name": "HttpRequestInferencer", "type": "InferenceResponse", "item": "## Phase 1: Datapoint Area Analysis and Query Development\n\n### Area 1: Entity Identification and Categorization Data\n\nThis datapoint area focuses on identifying all the key entities (characters, organizations, locations, etc.) that are connected to Puss in Boots and categorizing the nature of these relationships.

consolidated\n- Some queries are too broad and should be split into more focused searches  \n- Real-world production details and fictional universe details should be clearly separated\n- Cultural and

Check that no critical datapoint areas are under-represented in the query list.\n- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Identify and merge overlapping queries that would retrieve substantially similar information. However, keep queries separate if they target different aspects even if topically related.\n- **Consider Search Engine Effectiveness**: Be specific and concrete. Focus each query on one clear aspect. Avoid combining disparate topics\n- **Prioritize Queries**: Rank query priorites by high/medium/low according to\n  * Information density: How much essential backstory/cultural data will this retrieve?\n  * Foundational importance: Is this core to understanding the character or supplementary detail?\n  * Uniqueness: Does this retrieve information not covered by other queries?\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"refined_query_list\": [\n    {\n      \"query\": \"the optimized search query\",\n      \"datapoint_areas\": [{\"name\": \"...\", \"index\": ...}, ... a list of datapoint areas from Phase1 this query would address],\n      \"reason\": \"why this query is essential and what unique information it retrieves\",\n      \"priority\": \"high/medium/low\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n## TASK\n\nMake detailed reasoning on what queries are needed to retrieve various data points mentioned in `OBJECTIVES` for the following AI character\n\n```character\nMeet Puss in Boots, the favorite fearless hero and swashbuckling star.\n```", "time": "2025-10-21 10:50:10"}{"level": 10, "name": "HttpRequestInferencer", "type": "InferenceArgs", "item": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 20480, "max_new_tokens": 20480, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50}, "time": "2025-10-21 10:50:10"}{"level": 10, "name": "HttpRequestInferencer", "type": "InferenceResponse", "item": "## Phase 1: Datapoint Areas and Query Analysis\n\n### Area 1: Personal Preferences Profile\n\nThis datapoint area encompasses Puss in Boots' individual tastes, interests, and lifestyle choices across multiple domains.
