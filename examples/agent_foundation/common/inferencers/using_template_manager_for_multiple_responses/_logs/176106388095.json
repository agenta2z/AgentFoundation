Check that no critical datapoint areas are under-represented in the query list.\n- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Identify and merge overlapping queries that would retrieve substantially similar information. However, keep queries separate if they target different aspects even if topically related.\n- **Consider Search Engine Effectiveness**: Be specific and concrete. Focus each query on one clear aspect. Avoid combining disparate topics\n- **Prioritize Queries**: Rank query priorites by high/medium/low according to\n  * Information density: How much essential backstory/cultural data will this retrieve?\n  * Foundational importance: Is this core to understanding the character or supplementary detail?\n  * Uniqueness: Does this retrieve information not covered by other queries?\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"refined_query_list\": [\n    {\n      \"query\": \"the optimized search query\",\n      \"datapoint_areas\": [{\"name\": \"...\", \"index\": ...}, ... a list of datapoint areas from Phase1 this query would address],\n      \"reason\": \"why this query is essential and what unique information it retrieves\",\n      \"priority\": \"high/medium/low\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n## TASK\n\nMake detailed reasoning on what queries are needed to retrieve various data points mentioned in `OBJECTIVES` for the following AI character\n\n```character\nMeet Puss in Boots, the favorite fearless hero and swashbuckling star.\n```", "time": "2025-10-21 09:24:40"}{"level": 10, "name": "HttpRequestInferencer", "type": "InferenceArgs", "item": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "max_new_tokens": 20480, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50}, "time": "2025-10-21 09:24:40"}{"level": 10, "name": "HttpRequestInferencer", "type": "InferenceResult", "item": "## Phase 1: Datapoint Area Analysis and Query Development\n\n### 1.
